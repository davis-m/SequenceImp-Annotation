### WELCOME TO THE REPEAT ANNOTATION PIPELINE ###

This pipeline will take the specified repeat FASTA file and convert it to a
Bowtie index.  In addition it will organise an accompanying repeat length file
required for analysis. The pipeline should be passed the seqimp annotation base
directory as it will build a repeat annotation directory in here that will be
compatible with the seqimp pipeline. The repeat pipeline will convert a single
repeat FASTA at a time and store the results in the relevant species
subdirectory. Note that the species name specified for each repeat should be
the version of the name that matches the pipeline nomenclature. For each
species any number of uniquely named repeat sequences can be added.  Samples
submitted to the analysis pipeline will be compared to each in turn.

-i The reapeat FASTA file from which the Bowtie index should be built
-o The annotation directory into which the repeat annotation directories should 
   be built
-s The name of the species to which the repeat belongs. The species name should 
   match seqimp nomenclature as it will be used to identify the repeat files
-r The repeat type for which the bowtie index is being built. This should be 
   informative and unique as it will be used by the seqimp to name result files.
   This name must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
   The sequence should be traceable in the NCBI repository based upon this name.
-l The path to the repeat length script.
-v The version of the annotation being created
-h Displays these options
